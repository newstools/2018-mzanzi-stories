He should have set a moral example of what is acceptable conduct and prepare the children for a self-respecting career and life beyond school.  Instead he has abused his position and what he has done is evil.  But you  have done worse by placing a video on social media.  These kids did not agree to the sexual act with the understanding that it will be made public.  You have humiliated them and have burdened them with this terrible legacy.  What you sow you will reap Editor - this the principle of cause and effect.  You will do well to adopt biblical values and principles and it will impart much needed integrity. Shame on you!  Louis
